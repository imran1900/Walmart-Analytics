# **Walmart-Analytics**

## **Description**
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales) contains information on the factors influencing walmart's revenue, such as the price of fuel, consumer price index, air temparature in the region and unemployment rate for each given week. Walmart is one of the largest American multinational retail store that runs operations in the United states and in 23 other countries. The dataset provides the opportunity to explore the factors affecting walmart's profit margin and generate actionable insights.


## **Objectives**
This analysis seeks to identify patterns in Walmart's sales and derive actionable insights by exploring the factors affecting profit margins. The scope of this analysis includes:
- Sales Trends: Evaluating temporal sales performance to identify trends and seasonal fluctuations.
- Holiday Influence: Assess the impact of holiday seasons on sales performance, and determine the events that coincide with increases in revenue.
- Store-Level Performance: Benchmark sales of individual stores to distinguish high-performing and underperforming stores.
- Correlation with External Factors: Analyzing the relationship between sales and external economic factors including CPI, Fuel Price, Weather Conditions and Unemployment.

## **Executive Summary**

This analysis was performed based on 3 dimensions - Sales Trends and Holiday Influence, Store-Level Performance, and Impact of External Economic Factors on Sales Performance. Walmart experienced peak sales during the Holiday month of December, with record revenues of $288.7 million in 2010 and $288.1 million in 2011. Significant fluctuation are also seen in the Holidays months of Spring, April and Summer, June-July consistently generating over $220 million each year. In contrast, January consistently registers the lowest monthly sales of $160 million each year. Year-over-year performance increased by 7% from 2010 to 2011 but fell by 18.3% in 2012, due to missing data for November-December 2012. 

Store ID 2, 4, 13 and 20 ranked as top performers each year with store 20 generating the highest cumulative sales of over $300 million every year. Conversely, stores 4, 5, 36 and 44 consistently underperormed with store 33 generating Walmart's lowest sales of $11.4 million in 2012. It is suggested to boost underperforming stores by increasing visibility and awareness through holiday promotions, in-store events to drive foot traffic and exclusive in-store promotions to convert online customers into store visits.

External economic factors such as CPI, unemployment, temperature and fuel price show little to no correlation with the company's sales performance. Although fuel prices fluctuate during peak seasons particularly in holiday seasons, Spring and Winter, little evidence suggests these factors have no effect on consumer spending.

**Sales Trends and Holiday Influence**

<kbd><img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ea30e58-d60d-4ea7-9b36-cf6d95035d3f"></kbd>

- Company sales peaked in December, 2010 with a monthly revenue of $288.7 million, and its second highest sales revenue is seen in December, 2011 with a monthly revenue of $288.1 million.
- Company sales fluctuate in April and between the months of June until year-end December. Outside of the months mentioned, sales return to normal levels hovering around a monthly revenue of $190 million. The month of April is associated with Spring/ Easter, June to August with Summer, September with Fall, and November/ December with Christmas. This corresponds to change in consumer behavior as a result of holiday seasons.
- Company sales are at its lowest in January with a monthly revenue of $163.7 million in 2011 and $168.9 in 2012 despite January being associated with the New Years holiday.
- The company's YoY growth increases by 7% from 2010 to 2011, a total revenue of $2.29 million to $2.45 million. However, YoY growth drops by 18.3% from 2011 to 2012 due to unavailability of data for the months November and December which can be attributed to the highest monthly revenue.

**Store-Level Performance**

- In each year, store ID's 2, 4, 13 and 20 are consistently within the top 5 stores by sales revenue. The highest sales revenue was made by store 20 amounting to a grand total $301.4 million. $278.9 million were made from Non-Holiday sales and $22.4 million from Holiday sales.
- On the contrary, store ID's 4, 5, 33, 36 and 44 are all consistently within the lowest 5 stores by sales revenue.

- Referencing the correlation matrix, there is little to no correlation between external economic factors affecting walmart sales revenue.
- The chart shows fuel tends to peak between Spring - Summer. Seasonal peaks for fuel usually occur in April, May and November then troughs in January and September. We can attibtue this to the peaks found in our chart. $3.96 per litre in May, 2011 and $3.97 in April, 2012
- Temperature averages around 60Â°F and peaks in Summer between the months of June - August. However no adverse effect on sales revenue despite high temperature levels.
- Over the 3 years, CPI levels averages between 168.1 and 175.5. CPI peaks in the months of November - December, 168.6 in November, 2010, and 173.75 in December, 2011. Despite reaching yearly highs, it hasn't influenced consumer spending behaviors.
- Over the 3 years, unemployment averages around 8.0, with its lowest at 7.8 between October - December in 2011, and highest at 8.62 between February - March in 2010. Unemployment levels seems to decrease over time an stabilizes towards year-end. Despite this, changing unemployment levels do not affect sales revenue.

**Insights and Recommendation**
- Focus marketing efforts towards peak months, especially in the months November - December, by advertising holiday promotions 1 or 2 months prior to the actual holiday season, or having a holiday campaign collaboration with influencers for better awareness outreach.
- Establish strong brand presence on popular social media platforms such as instagram, tik tok or facebook to have better outreach to all age categories and also compliments holiday collaboration with influencers.
- Distribute inventory based on store sales performance instead of equal proportions to keep up with consumer demands and bolster inventory levels for products with high sales conversion ratio.
- Implement aggresive marketing strategies to stores that are making below average sales revenue. One strategy is to boost visibility and awareness of the store and its promotions through social media, collaboration with influencers, or strategic banner placement. Another strategy is to host in-store events such as product launches or workshops to create a buzz and attracts potential yet curious consumers. Lastly, encourage online customers from social media to visit stores by offering exclusive in-store promotions and discounts.
